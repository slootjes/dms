# Document Management System (work in progress)

## Concept
Put all your pdf documents in a directory structure like this:

/{year}/{month}/{date} - {sender} - {receiver} - {subject}.pdf

or if there is no specific receiver:

/{year}/{month}/{date} - {sender} - {subject}.pdf

Make sure your pdf documents contain actual text (using ocr if needed) to improve reliability.

## App

The app can index your documents in Elasticsearch and provides an easy to use tool to list, search, view and download your documents.

You can use this software as-is without any warranty.
